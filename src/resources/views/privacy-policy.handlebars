                Lazada takes user privacy seriously and collects and processes personal data in the course of providing services on its platform. This privacy policy exists to inform users about how Lazada collects, uses, discloses, stores, and processes data, including personal data. Users should read this policy together with other applicable notices to fully understand how their personal data is being used. The policy may be updated from time to time, and users are responsible for reviewing it frequently. The policy applies to all users of Lazada's platform, whether they are customers or sellers.</p>

                <p><b>2. Personal data we collect from you</b><br> 
                The platform collects personal data in accordance with local laws and with the individual's consent. Personal data is defined as any information about an individual that can identify them, either directly or indirectly. The types of personal data collected include identity and profile data, account and transaction data, usage data, marketing and communications data, and location data. This data is collected in various situations, such as when browsing the platform, creating an account, conducting transactions, using payment-related functions, or participating in campaigns. The platform may also collect personal data from third parties or automatically when using the platform or services. Users are required to provide accurate and up-to-date personal data, and the platform reserves the right to verify this information. Certain categories of personal data can only be collected with the individual's voluntary consent. The text also indicates that users consent to the transfer of their personal data from third parties or affiliates to the platform.</p>

                <p>3. Scope of use and disclosure of your personal data <br> 
                The document outlines the purposes for which personal data collected by the company may be used and disclosed, in accordance with applicable local laws and regulations, and with the user's consent. The purposes vary depending on the user's relationship with the company, which may be as a customer, seller, website visitor, or mobile application user.<br>

                For customers and registered users, personal data collected may be used to process orders for products, deliver products, update customers on delivery status, provide customer support, and verify and carry out payment transactions. Additionally, the data may be used to display user profiles, facilitate the use of mini-apps available on the platform, respond to queries, and assess applications for loan facilities.<br>

                For all users, personal data may be used to improve user experience, conduct analytics, research, and development, and for legal and operational purposes such as fraud detection, complaints processing, and compliance with legal and regulatory requirements. Data may also be shared with third parties for business purposes, such as proposed mergers or acquisitions, as long as requirements under applicable data protection laws are satisfied.<br>

                Marketing and advertising purposes include providing users with information they may find useful, sending marketing or promotional information about products and services on the platform, conducting marketing and advertising, and promoting services by using user-generated content that may be shared publicly.<br>

                In addition, any other purpose for which user consent has been obtained may be pursued, in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. The company takes its obligations under data protection laws seriously and seeks to ensure that user data is processed in a fair, lawful, and transparent manner. </p>

                <p>4. Withdrawal of consent to continued use, disclosure, storing and/or processing of personal data <br>  
                The user can withdraw their consent for the use, disclosure, storing, and/or processing of their personal data by contacting the company. However, if they do so, the company may not be able to continue providing the services or performing any contract with the user. The user can also unsubscribe from receiving marketing information at any time.</p>

                <p>5. Personal information protection commitment <br>  
                The measures include restricting access to personal data to only those who require it, using SSL encryption technology to process financial details, and implementing other security measures as required by law. However, the platform acknowledges that no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is entirely secure, and users are advised to exercise caution when sharing personal data and authentication details outside the platform. In summary, the platform strives to protect user data and constantly reviews and enhances its information security measures.</p>
